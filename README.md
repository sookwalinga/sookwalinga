Hi there! ðŸ‘‹ Iâ€™m Sam, a software developer passionate about using technology to serve people and create lasting, positive change. With 4+ years of experience, I build thoughtful, practical solutions that address real-world problems and deliver meaningful impact.

I work remotely with World Merit and contribute to open-source projects like the Community Health Toolkit (CHT) at Medic, improving healthcare delivery in under-resourced communities.

My mission extends beyond code: every challenge is an opportunity to create something that matters. Guided by purpose, I'm committed to impactful problem-solving, from digital inclusion initiatives to youth empowerment projects.

I'm currently deepening my skills to move from implementation to software architecture, focusing on designing scalable, resilient, and purpose-driven systems.

Iâ€™m always eager to collaborate on impactful projects and connect with others who believe in using technology to build a better future. Letâ€™s connect! <p align="center">
